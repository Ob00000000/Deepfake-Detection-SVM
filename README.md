# 🎭 Deepfake Detection using SVM and Facial Landmarks

This project is a Deepfake Detection web application that uses facial landmarks extracted from video frames and classifies them as **Real** or **Fake** using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

## 📌 Features

- Upload a video for deepfake analysis
- Frame-wise facial landmark extraction
- SVM-based binary classification (Real vs Fake)
- Displays prediction, confidence score, and reasoning
- Real-time loader and result display in UI

## 📥 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepfake-detection.git
cd deepfake-detection
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed. Then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Required packages:**

```txt
flask
flask-cors
opencv-python
dlib
numpy
scikit-learn
joblib
```

### 3. Download Pretrained Models

- **68-point landmark predictor** (required by dlib):  
  [Download from here](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2)  
  Extract and place in the project directory.

- **SVM Model:**  
  Ensure `svm_face_classifier.pkl` is available in the root directory.

## 🚀 Running the App

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser and visit:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Video Upload** – User uploads a short video (max 100MB).
2. **Frame Sampling** – Every 30th frame is selected up to a limit (50 frames max).
3. **Facial Landmark Detection** – 68 landmarks are extracted using dlib.
4. **Feature Averaging** – Features across frames are averaged.
5. **Classification** – The averaged features are classified using a trained SVM.
6. **Result** – The prediction, confidence score, and reasoning are displayed.
